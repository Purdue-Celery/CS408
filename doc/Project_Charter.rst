Problem Statement
-----------------
The student organization PUCSSA holds a talent competition every year. The host needs an electronic managing system to record scores for the competition.

Project Objectives
-----------------
We will create a managing system for PUCSSA's talent competition consisting of several rounds, in which each contestant will show his or her talent in different fields. The system will allow contestants to view their qualification, schedule of competitions, and scores. It will also allow judges to manage the schedule of each competition, assign qualified contestants to next round, and to easily review the final results.

Stakeholders
------------
Competition judges and contestants.

Project Deliverables
--------------------
An electronic managing system for talent competition based on an oracle database implemented as a Java application. The application will provide user with a graphical interface, and will respond to user operation by querying and interpreting the database.
